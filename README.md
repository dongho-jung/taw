# PAW (Parallel AI Workers)

[![CI](https://github.com/dongho-jung/paw/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dongho-jung/paw/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/dongho-jung/paw/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dongho-jung/paw/actions/workflows/release.yml)

A project management system built on Claude Code.

## Installation

```bash
brew install dongho-jung/tap/paw
```

## Overview

- Start a tmux-based workspace from any directory with the `paw` command.
- Creating a task automatically launches the Claude Code agent.
- **Git mode**: Each task gets its own worktree when running in a git repo.
- **Non-Git mode**: Works without git; tasks run in the project directory.

## Usage

### Start paw in a project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project  # git repo or regular directory
paw  # Creates .paw, starts tmux session, and automatically runs new-task
```

- In a git repo: Git mode (worktree created per task)
- In a regular directory: Non-Git mode (works directly in the project directory)

The first launch automatically opens the task editor.

### Create a task

To add another task inside the tmux session, press `⌃N`:
- The editor opens so you can write the task content.
- Save and exit to automatically launch the agent.
- vi/vim/nvim start in insert mode automatically.

### Slash Commands

Slash commands available to the agent:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/commit` | Smart commit (analyzes the diff and generates a message) |
| `/test` | Detects and runs project tests |
| `/pr` | Creates a PR and opens the browser |
| `/merge` | Merges the worktree branch into the current project branch |

**Task completion**:
- `auto-merge` mode: Automatically commit → merge → clean up → close the window when the task ends
- Other modes: Press `⌃F` to commit → PR/merge → clean up according to ON_COMPLETE

<details>
<summary>Automatically reopen incomplete tasks with session resume</summary>

If a task is left unfinished and the window or tmux session closes, the next `paw` run automatically reopens those task windows.

**Session Resume**: When reopening, Claude automatically continues the previous conversation session (using `claude --continue`), preserving the full conversation history and context. The agent continues exactly where it left off without restarting from scratch.

<details>
<summary>Automatically clean up merged tasks</summary>

Tasks merged externally (PR merge, direct branch merge, etc.) are cleaned up automatically when `paw` runs.
