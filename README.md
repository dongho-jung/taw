# TAW (Tmux + Agent + Worktree)

A project management system built on Claude Code.

## Overview

- Start a tmux-based workspace from any directory with the `taw` command.
- Creating a task automatically launches the Claude Code agent.
- **Git mode**: Each task gets its own worktree when running in a git repo.
- **Non-Git mode**: Works without git; tasks run in the project directory.

## Usage

### Start taw in a project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project  # git repo or regular directory
taw  # Creates .taw, starts tmux session, and automatically runs new-task
```

- In a git repo: Git mode (worktree created per task)
- In a regular directory: Non-Git mode (works directly in the project directory)

The first launch automatically opens the task editor.

### Create a task

To add another task inside the tmux session, press `⌃⇧N`:
- The editor opens so you can write the task content.
- Save and exit to automatically launch the agent.
- vi/vim/nvim start in insert mode automatically.

### Slash Commands

Slash commands available to the agent:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/commit` | Smart commit (analyzes the diff and generates a message) |
| `/test` | Detects and runs project tests |
| `/pr` | Creates a PR and opens the browser |
| `/merge` | Merges the worktree branch into the current project branch |

**Task completion**:
- `auto-merge` mode: Automatically commit → merge → clean up → close the window when the task ends (no ⌃⇧E needed)
- Other modes: Press `⌃⇧E` to commit → PR/merge → clean up according to ON_COMPLETE

<summary>Automatically reopen incomplete tasks</summary>

If a task is left unfinished and the window or tmux session closes, the next `taw` run automatically reopens those task windows.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Automatically clean up merged tasks</summary>

Tasks merged externally (PR merge, direct branch merge, etc.) are cleaned up automatically when `taw` runs.
</details>

### Window states

- ⭐️ New task input window
- 🤖 Working
- 💬 Waiting (user input required)
- ✅ Done
- ⚠️ Warning (merge failed, needs manual resolution)
